# GPT-Chat-Prompts-Guide

This repository is designed to help developers understand and effectively use GPT prompts to improve their productivity in software development. Each prompt is stored in its own file for easy reference and organization.

## Understanding Prompts

A prompt is a set of instructions that you give to the GPT model. It consists of several components:

- **Task**: The action you want the model to perform.
- **Context**: Any information that the model needs to perform the task.
- **Examples**: Specific instances of the task being performed correctly.
- **Persona** (Optional): The character or role that the model should assume.
- **Format** (Optional): The way you want the model's output to be structured.
- **Tone** (Optional): The mood or attitude that the model's output should convey.

If it was a function, a prompt might look something like this:

```typescript
type Example = {
  input: string;
  output: string;
};

type GPTPrompt = (
  task: string,
  context: string,
  examples: Example[],
  persona?: string,
  format?: string,
  tone?: string,
) => string;
```

This means that when we use GPT, the quality of the output is directly related to the quality of the prompt. The more specific and detailed the prompt, the better the output will be.

Check out the [Prompt Anatomy](./PROMPT_ANATOMY.md) guide for more information on how to structure effective prompts.

## Examples

This repository contains a variety of examples to help you understand how to engineer effective prompts. Each example includes a detailed explanation of the task, context, and examples, as well as the optional persona, format, and tone.

## Directory Structure

The prompts are organized into directories based on their purpose or the tasks they perform. Here are the main directories:

- **Getting Started**: Prompts that help new users understand the basics of using GPT.

Additional directories may be added in the future to accommodate new prompts and concepts.

Each directory contains a README file that provides an overview of the prompts in that directory and any additional information that might be helpful.

## Usage

To use these prompts, simply open the desired file and follow the instructions in the prompt. The prompts are designed to be used in a question-and-answer format, with the user asking a question and GPT generating the code in response.

Remember to provide clear and concise instructions to GPT, and to be patient with the model as it generates the code. If the generated code is not what you expected, try rephrasing the question or providing additional context to help GPT understand your request.

Don't forget to check the [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide for additional tips and information on using GPT to generate code.
