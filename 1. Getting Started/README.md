## Overview

Each file in this repository represents a different programming concept and contains a prompt for generating code related to that concept. The prompts are designed to be used with GPT-4 and can be adapted for use with other versions of GPT.

## Usage

To use these prompts, simply open the desired file and follow the instructions in the prompt. The prompts are designed to be used in a question-and-answer format, with the user asking a question and GPT-4 generating the code in response.

Remember to provide clear and concise instructions to GPT-4, and to be patient with the model as it generates the code. If the generated code is not what you expected, try rephrasing the question or providing additional context to help GPT-4 understand your request.

Don't forget to check the [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) guide for additional tips and information on using GPT to generate code.
