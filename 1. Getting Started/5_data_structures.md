# Data Structures Prompt

## Goal of the Prompt

The goal of this prompt is to generate an implementation of a queue (FIFO) in [language] using generics, along with tests to ensure the rules of FIFO are followed.

## Prompt

"Generate an implementation of a generic queue in [language], and write tests to ensure it follows the FIFO rule."

## Explanation

This prompt is designed to generate a simple implementation of a generic queue (FIFO) in [language], along with tests to ensure the rules of FIFO are followed. The generated code should define a queue that can hold any type of values, provide methods for basic operations like enqueue (add to the end) and dequeue (remove from the front), and include tests to verify the FIFO behavior.

## Variations

- "I'm working on a Go project where I need to implement a queue that can hold strings. Can you help me with this, and also generate tests to ensure it follows the FIFO rule?"
- "In TypeScript, how can I implement a queue that can store objects of a specific type? All objects in a specific queue need to be of the same type. Also, how can I write tests to ensure it follows the FIFO rule?"
- "I'm a beginner in [language] and I'm trying to implement a queue that can hold integers. Can you show me how to do it, and also write tests to ensure it follows the FIFO rule?"
