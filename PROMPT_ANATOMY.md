## Explanation

**Task**: This is the main action that the AI is being asked to perform. It should be clear and concise.

**Context**: This provides additional information that can help the AI understand the task better. It can include the user's skill level, the purpose of the task, etc.

**Examples**: These are specific instances of the task being performed correctly. They can help the AI understand what the output should look like.

**Persona**: This defines the role that the AI is playing. It can affect how the AI phrases its responses.

**Format**: This specifies how the response should be structured. It can include the programming language, the type of code (function, class, etc.), etc.

**Tone**: This sets the mood for the AI's responses. It can be friendly, formal, casual, etc., depending on the user's preference.

Remember, the goal of a prompt is to guide the AI in generating a useful response. The more information you provide, the better the AI can understand what you're asking for.
